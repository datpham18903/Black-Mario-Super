<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation 
*Prerequisites*: Make sure that the following dependencies are installed on your machine:
-   Java 21
-  	Javafx
-  	Java AWT
-  	Javax.swing
-   Java 2D


<!-- MOTIVATION -->
## Motivation 
We are working with this game as our project lab of Object Oriented Programming is a 4-credit course. During our investigation into how to create 2D games with Java, we made the decision to enhance the Mario game, which was formerly quite well-known and familiar to many people.

<!-- CHALLENGES -->
# Challenges
- Interacting with Pre-existing Code: The established codebase was complex to comprehend and modify. At times, the rigidity of the classes and packages made the implementation of new features challenging.
- Difficulty Calibration: Striking an optimal balance to ensure the game is engaging yet not overly difficult for players was a demanding task.
- Employing JavaFX Framework: Our unfamiliarity with the JavaFX framework posed a challenge in leveraging it efficiently.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
# Acknowledgments
